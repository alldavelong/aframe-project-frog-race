# aframe-project-frog-race

This is my first A-Frame project to get to know the possibilities offered by the A-Frame framework.

The requirements for this project were:
* one a-plane as floor and one a-sky
* at least one animation
* at least one gaze-based interaction with an element
* at least one element with an added texture
* at least one imported gltf-model
* at least one custom light
* at least one added sound effect
